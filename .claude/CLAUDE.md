## API Reference
When the user says "use API", "use Amadeus API", or references any Amadeus endpoint, always read `.claude/api_usage.md` for endpoint details (URLs, params, request bodies, auth flow). If an endpoint isn't documented there, check the source Postman collection at `Postman collection/Amadeus for Developers.postman_collection.json`.
